# Short-Circuit-Calculator
The application is able to calculate the position of a short circuit on a 2 wire (or more) cable, using measured resitance values from it. There is also implemented a small databank, which can import and export data. Also the calculated short circuit spots can be printed out directly to a printer. I programmed the tool during my work in a cable company to make my life more easy :-)
